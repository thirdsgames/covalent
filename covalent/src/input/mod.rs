//! # Code copied from `winit`
//! Some of this module is copied from the `winit` crate (0.22.2), which is a dependency of the
//! `covalent_gl` graphics backend. The code is included here because it is very backend-agnostic,
//! and means we don't need to include `winit` as a dependency for the whole `covalent` crate.
//! This allows for more flexibility with designing a graphics backend, and also leaves room
//! to just not make a graphics backend at all (e.g. for server-side code).
